# Welcome

Welcome to the Business Automation Pro membership site. Thank you for joining and I hope you will enjoy this journey as much as I will. I'm Andrew Molloy and I started this site because I kept seeing the same questions appearing in various business and entrepreneur groups, and mentioning how they run their businesses day to day. Many had not even heard of the most basic productivity and automation tools available (many for free), and usually the first suggestion by even veteran business leaders is to "outsource"/hire an employee etc to take repetitive, tedious or bottleneck work off their plate. This is a big surprise to me as my background is a mixture of computing and engineering as well as pursuing my own business endeavours. Considering most people actually run almost their entire businesses from their computers and mobile phones it seemed like such an obvious thing to me to use those devices we're already using to automate as much as possible. Why hire someone to do something that might even be possible for your phone to do with a single press. But people don't know to ask the right questions if they don't know something even exists, and that's why I wanted to start this. It's not just about what tools or systems that are available, it's about getting you to ask the right questions, look at your own business and even day to day life in a different way. Remove the tedium and spend your valuable time on the more important things that actually require your input.
